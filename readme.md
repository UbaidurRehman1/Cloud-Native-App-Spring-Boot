Note
---
For now: It only converts USD to PKR as there is only one entry in a database.
I will populate a database with all available exchange rates each 15 minutes using another micro-service.

About
----
- Cloud Native App which convert currency from given counter to targeted counter. 
- Client Service is actual responsible to interact with micro-services using api-gateway-server. 
- We send a request to client service, it interacts with *CURRENCY-EXCHANGE-SERVICE* to get exchange rate and then *CURRENCY-CONVERSION-SERVICE* to convert this currency
- For more info see wiki.

Requirements
-----------
- Maven 3.6.3 or later
- Docker 19.03.8 or later
- JDK 14 or later

How to Run
----------

-   ```cd envcn```
-   ```./run.sh``` (it will run all tools which our services needs such as naming server, db, zipkin etc)
-   ``` cd ..``` 
-   ``` ./run.sh ```
