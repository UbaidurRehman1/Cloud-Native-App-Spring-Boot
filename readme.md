Abstract
========
- This repo represents a basic currency conversion cloud native-app which convert currency from given country code to targeted country code.
- I am using the following stack for this cloud native app.   
    - [Micro-Service Architecture with Gateway-Server along with Discovery Server]()
    - [Spring Cloud Security OAuth2 With KeyCloak Server]()
    - [ELK Stack]()
    - [Distributed Tracing]()
- Following are the Tools and technologies which I am using:
  - Java 16
  - Spring Boot 2.4.4
  - Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (Security, Config Server, Service Discovery and Distributed Tracing)
  - ELK Stack Version 7.10.0
  - KeyCloak Server (Authorization Server) 12.0.1
    
Auth Flow
=========
- [Please visit here](./resource/auth/auth-flow.md)

Requirements
-----------
- [Maven 3.8.1 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md#install-maven-and-jdk-16)
- [Docker 19.03.13 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md#install-docker)
- [JDK 16 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md#install-maven-and-jdk-16)
- [Set JAVA_HOME](./resource/install-require-softwares.md#install-maven-and-jdk-16)
- [Set MAVEN_HOME and M2_HOME](./resource/install-require-softwares.md#install-maven-and-jdk-16)

How to Run
----------
-   ``` git clone https://github.com/UbaidurRehman1/Cloud-Native-App-Spring-Boot```
-   ``` cd Cloud-Native-App-Spring-Boot```
-   ```mvn clean install -DskipTests```
-   ```cd envcn```
-   ```./run.sh``` (it will run all tools which our services needs such as keycloak server, naming server, databases, zipkin, rabbitmq and elk-stack)
-   ``` cd ..```
-   ``` ./run.sh ``` (it will up the micro-services)


About
----
- Cloud Native App which convert currency from given country code to targeted country code. 
- Currency Conversion Rest API  is actual responsible to interact with micro-services using ```api-gateway-server```. 
- An Actor (React Client, React Native Client) can  send a request to api-composer, it interacts with *CURRENCY-EXCHANGE-SERVICE*  micro-service to get exchange rate and then *CURRENCY-CONVERSION-SERVICE* micro-service to convert this currency
- ![Micro Service Architecture](resource/3cnAuthFlow.png)
- In above diagram, We have 
    - Two micro-services ```currency-exchange-service```  and ```currency-conversion-service``` helps us to convert currency from one country code to another country code.
    - An api-gateway-server (which is responsible to redirect requests to micro-services)
    - A ```country-micro-service``` which returns all countries with their respect Code
    - An api-composer which expose their URLs to Clients (and is interacts with API gateway server)
    - ELK Stack, for Centralized Logging
    - Auth Server (For OAuth2 Authentication and Authorization)
    - Naming Server (For services discovery)
    - Distributed Tracing Stack, for micro-services tracing
