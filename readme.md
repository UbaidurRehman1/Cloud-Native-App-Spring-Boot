Abstract
========
- Cloud Native App represent basic reference for different stacks such as
    - micro-service architecture 
    - gateway server
    - naming server
    - AOP
    - ELK stack
    - distributed tracing with zipkin
    - containerization
    - swagger implementation
- My aim is to remain up to date with each stack such as Java 15, Spring Boot 2.3.4 and Spring Cloud HOXTON SR8

Note
---
For now: It only converts USD to PKR as there is only one entry in a database.
I will populate a database with all available exchange rates each 15 minutes using another micro-service.

About
----
- Cloud Native App which convert currency from given country code to targeted country code. 
- Currency Conversion Rest API  is actual responsible to interact with micro-services using ```api-gateway-server```. 
- An Actor (React Client, Angular Client etc ) can  send a request to rest-api, it interacts with *CURRENCY-EXCHANGE-SERVICE*  micro-service to get exchange rate and then *CURRENCY-CONVERSION-SERVICE* micro-service to convert this currency
- ![Micro Service Architecture](resource/micro-service-architecture.png)
- In above diagram [You Can Access it here: Pre-Req: Run the App First](http://localhost:9411/zipkin/), We have 
    - Two micro-services in which ```currency-exchange-service```  and ```currency-conversion-service``` helps us to convert currency from one country code to another country code.
    - One api-gateway-server
    - One rest-api which expose their URLs to Clients

Requirements
-----------
- [Maven 3.6.3 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md)
- [Docker 19.03.8 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md)
- [JDK 15 or later](./resource/install-require-softwares.md)
- [Set JAVA_HOME](./resource/install-require-softwares.md)

How to Run
----------
-   ``` git clone https://github.com/UbaidurRehman1/Cloud-Native-App-Spring-Boot```
-   ``` cd Cloud-Native-App-Spring-Boot```
-   ```mvn clean install -DskipTests```
-   ```cd envcn```
-   ```./run.sh``` (it will run all tools which our services needs such as naming server, db, zipkin etc)
-   ``` cd ..``` 
-   ``` ./run.sh ``` 

How it works
------------
- Simply go to Swagger UI and interact with different end points.

Swagger UI
----------
- [Go here to check API docs about Currency Conversion API](http://localhost:5200/swagger-ui.html#/exchange-controller)

Kibana Dashboard (For Centralized Logging)
------------------------------------------
- [Go here to view centralized logs](http://localhost:5601/app/discover#)
- username : elastic
- password : changeme
- Select logstash-* index pattern like below graphic and then you will see the logs
